      <description>Hi! Thanks for reading this post. :D
So, you made a website. Why? Because of a recent job search, there are several reasons I created this site:
Proof: As a somewhat new technical writer (five years and counting!), this site serves as an example of what I am capable of. I dove headfirst into this career path knowing next to nothing about it, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way. Ease of access: When courting prospective employers, it&amp;rsquo;s very convenient to provide on-demand examples of your work.</description>
