        <em>GoDaddy - A good place to start a web project</em><br><br>
        To create this site, I did the following:<br>
        <ul>Reserved a domain<br>
        Set up the DNS<br> 
        Pointed CNAME and A records at GitHub (host)<br><br></ul>
        It feels good to put a website on the internet. :)

        <em>How I made this site!</em><br><br>
        We used Hugo at StrongDM, and I wanted to keep learning it. So, I did.<br><br>
        Here are some other things I'd like to do with Hugo:<br>
        <ul>Add a search feature to this site<br>
        Generate a structured documentation site<br>
        Eventually create a Hugo portfolio template</ul>

        When you create documentation (or code), versioning is everything. A popular tool for this is GitHub, which we used at StrongDM. 
        Our wise manager suggested we tech writers learn some Git to understand what goes on "under the hood" in GitHub.<br><br> 
        When I began learning Git, it really brought depth and context to using GitHub. Every <em>git commit</em> came to life in the GitHub UI.
        Using Git for more than docs versioning (e.g., code, websites, etc.) is super helpful, too.

        Using GitHub to manage a docs site is great for keeping track of changes.<br>

        What are some of the steps necessary to start a documentation effort?<br> 
        For instance, one of the initial steps is actually recording Zoom or call sessions and be able to distil it later into meaningful and ready-to-consume formats.
        Knowing how to use STT tools to facilitate this process is a must.
