#### Hi!

Thanks for reading this post. :D

#### So, you made a website. Why?

 Because of a recent job search, there are several reasons I created this site:

 - **Proof**: As a somewhat new technical writer (five years and counting!), this site serves as an example of what I am capable of. I dove headfirst into this career path knowing next to nothing about it, and I've come a long way.
 - **Ease of access**: When courting prospective employers, it's very convenient to provide on-demand examples of your work.
 - **Credit**: When you document a software product, the documentation is part of the product. On my website, I can proudly display what I created and contributed.
 - **Archiving**: The majority of my works exist on servers that are not mine, or in documents that are editable by others. Taking snapshots (i.e., PDFs) helps me remember that, oh yeah, I did write that.

#### Why use a static site generator to create this site?

During my time at StrongDM, we switched the static site generator for our [documentation site](https://www.strongdm.com/docs) to Hugo. I didn't get to play with it as much as I wanted to, so I decided to stick with it.

#### Why start blogging?

I gotta keep my ideas somewhere ...

#### What can I expect to see in the blog?

Dogs, stories about my mom, musings on futbol.
