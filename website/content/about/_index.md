#### Foreword

Hi! I am Ulderico! And I am Lizzy's boyfriend and I decided to write a foreword for her about page. See, she is very talented and thirsty for learning. She is a sponge of new knowledge, if you had seen how much she worked on her skills in these last couple of months, I bet you wouldn't be worried about A.I. -- the humankind got Lizzy on its corner. Also, she is very fun. Professionally speaking, she is as tough as it gets. She can get anything you throw at her done. Solid. In any case, sometimes she does get a little bit too perfectionist, and that doesn't really help deliver things... But hey, her name is Elizabeth and not Nobody. You should totally hire her.

Hi, I'm Elizabeth! I've been a technical writer since 2018.

I'm from South San Francisco, California. I own two dogs, Captain and Ripley.

If left to my own devices, I would try to live off of coffee and chocolate.

Football is life, and you should have watched Star Trek: The Next Generation by now.
